# hello-world
my first git repository

Here is matsumaruN on 20191010. Moarse application will be important, so not with google site, but with my private github.  The contact email is @gifu-pu.ac.jp, though...

Here is matsumaruN on 20180301. html generated with Rstudio needs to be published or shared with others.
To share, main is google site for some reasons. The problem is that Google site cannot work nicely with html file.
So, my idea was to publish html on github, and link to the google site.
Well, it is not possible to restrict user access...
